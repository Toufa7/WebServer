Dear Loubna

I hope this email finds you well

I wanted to touch base regarding our 2 ideas me and my collegue and the possibility of meeting regularly to work on it so i was wondering if it would be possible to set up a recurring weekly time for us to meet at your office, similar to office hours.

Let me know if there are any particular times that work best for us we're flexible and can adjust my schedule accordingly.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

Toufah Omar
